Get corners
Your piece shouldn't fall in any of 3 places surrounding the corner

Don't have too many pieces on corners - don't play corners in early and middle game
If enemy has one corner you should try to get the other one

Early game - try not taking many pieces, cuz the fewer pieces you have, more flexible you are

Have pieces in center?

Lower enemy's number of good moves by blocking legal moves

Endgame - last 20 moves of the game (41st move onward) - then you can try getting them discs flipped
